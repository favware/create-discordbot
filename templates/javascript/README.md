This project was bootstrapped with [Create Discord Bot](https://favware.tech/creatediscordbot).

## Before running any code

This project uses dotenv for configuration such as your token. The values are stored in the .env file you'll find in the same folder as this README. If you didn't set the token during setup you'll have to enter it in the file between the `" "` at the `BOT_TOKEN` line. For example:

```dotenv
BOT_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9"
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the discord bot<br>
Requires you have set the token in the `.env` file!

### `npm run lint`

Checks your code for linting errors

### `npm serve`

Runs the bot using the NodeJS process manager PM2.<br>
Requires you have set the token in the `.env` file!<br>
Requires you have `pm2` installed globally (`npm install -g pm2`)
