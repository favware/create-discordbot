# Install

## Using Yarn

```sh
yarn create djsbot
# or for reusability
yarn global add create-djsbot
create-djsbot mybot
```

## Using NPM

```sh
npx create-djsbot mybot
# or for reusability
npm install --global create-djsbot
create-djsbot mybot
```

### Answer some basic prompts about your module, and then the CLI will perform the following steps:

- copy over the template
- install dependencies via yarn or npm
- initialize local git repo

## Setting up development environment

If the template fails to run the `npm install` or `yarn install`, please follow these instructions before getting support:

   - Windows:
     - run `npm i windows-build-tools --production --vs2015 --add-python-to-PATH --global` in an administrative CMD or Powershell
   - MacOS:
     - Install the XCode Selects tools: `xcode-select --install`
     - Install Brew: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
   - Linux Debian / Ubuntu:
      -  Install build-essential: `sudo apt-get install -y build-essential`
   - Other OS / distro's:
      - Please google how to install build essentials such as GCC and Make

## Notes about the TypeScript template

A few notes should be shared about the TypeScript template that are important to note

1. It uses forks of Discord.JS and Discord.JS-Commando that are based on the "master" branch so please refer to the "master" documentation. The reason for this is that Commando has added a lot of extra TypeScript support since it's latest stable release and when using the "master" branch for Discord.JS-Commando then the master branch for Discord.JS should also be used. I (Favna) manage these forks and ensure they are always stable before publishing any updates as I use them in my own bot

2. In TypeScript you should to use ES6 imports/exports rather than CommonJS `module.exports` and `require` as it's far more efficient, adds a lot of cool features such as default exports, named exports and advanced imports and it's far easier to write and remember.

3. You should **not** use `ts-node` to run your bot unless during development. It is very slow and inefficient for production environments.

4. Therefore always compile your bot to JavaScript using `npm run build` or `yarn build`

5. And do not remove anything from the `build`, `prebuild`, `postbuild`, `copyfiles` or `replace` scripts. Doing so will either cause your bot to not build properly at all, or cause inefficiencies in the long term. Adding to it is perfectly fine however!

6. The TypeScript config allows you to use aliases for easier accessing the `commands` and `utils` folders. For example if you need to log something you can `import log from '@utils/winston'` (which imports the `winston.ts` file at `src/utils/winston.ts`, no matter how many subfolders deep you are) then use this as `log.info()`.

7. When getting support anywhere always specify that you are writing TypeScript to get the best support.

8. You can always join my server for support as well.
